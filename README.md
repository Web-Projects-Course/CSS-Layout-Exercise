# CSS layout exercise

This is an exercise to get you familiar with using CSS to layout a webpage. 

In addition to the raw files for the exercise this repository also contains various examples of how layout works in alternate branches. I'll show you in class how to install the git plugin for brackets so you can navigate these branches.

Here is an outline of the branches

* **1: Box model** - Some basic CSS to highlight the box model.
* **2: Absolute positioning**  - Making an image position absolute.
* **2b: Absolute positioning** - Adding top and left properties.
* **3: Fixed positioning** - Changing from absolute to fixed.
* **4: Floating elements** - Floating the image.
* **4b: Floating elements** - Floating the paragraphs instead.
* **4c: Floating elements** - Changing the image display type from inline-block to block.
* **4d: Floating elements** - Adding width to paragraphs.
* **5: Containing floats**  - Containing a floated element within its parent.
* **6: Floats for layout** - Creating a column layout with floats.
